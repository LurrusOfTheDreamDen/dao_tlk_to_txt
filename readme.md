This code is created to convert DAO tlk files to txt in the following format:

```
{StrRef} {text}
```

This code allows to convert the txt format above to the tlk files

### Usage:

1. Open this project in Visual studio or any C# IDE and compile as a console application
2. Run compiled console app with the following arguments

`{compiled_exe_file}.exe tlk2txt file.tlk file.txt` <- tlk to txt file

`{compiled_exe_file}.exe txt2tlk file.txt file.tlk` <- txt to tlk file
